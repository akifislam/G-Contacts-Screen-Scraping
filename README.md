# G-Contacts-Screen-Scraping
Go to [Google Contacts](contacts.google.com) from your University Mail. On the left panel, you will see 'Directory' which contains almost all the emails in your orgainzation.
But unfortunately, Google doesn't let you download all of them at once. Having all them can be great for any kind of digital marketing or other good purpose.
That's why, this repository was created to bypass Google's protection.
